Brian McClendon SE 333 Assignment 5

The goal of this project is to implement a robust continuous integration (CI) workflow for a Java-based project using Maven and GitHub Actions. The workflow automates several key quality checks and reporting steps to ensure code reliability and maintainability.

Part 1: Builds properly and tests have 100% coverage. Structual and Specification based tests are label properly.

Part 2: All GitHub actions are performed as they should and the build compiles and the tests run.

Part 3: All tests run and the program compiles.
